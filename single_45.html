									<p>As per the vision of our former President, Late Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam, India was supposed to upgrade itself to the elite club of developed nations by the year 2020. But sadly, we were destined to meet with a global catastrophe which severely hampered our economy to the extent of plummeting the GDP to a negative index for the first time in forty years. We often attribute the reasons behind Indiaâ€™s never-ending poverty to continuous foreign invasions which finally ended with the British colonization. But so were several countries around the globe, who are miles ahead of our country in several human development parameters. The world was hardly a peaceful place . Ruthless sieges and territorial expansions met with a halt only after the second world war, though not completely. The existence of nation states and stable governments are relatively a new idea that emerged a couple of centuries ago. Our nation missed to cash in the initial three industrial revolutions and further missed the opportunity to open our economy during the dawn of globalization. Those initial hiccups to embrace the change have cost us a lot. We are one of the youngest nations in the world, with half of the population below 25 years of age. We need to halt our inherent inertia and not miss the bus this time and be an active stakeholder in the ongoing fourth industrial revolution.</p>

									<p>The aim of this article is to establish about the myriad possibilities of blockchain in a densely populated country like India. Before getting into that, let us have a brief look at what this technology is all about. To put it simply, blockchain is nothing but a distributed database. It can be defined as a distributed digital ledger which stores data in a peer-to-peer network using cryptographic hash functions, without any central authority to supervise. The key point to note here is that there is no central authority here, like in the case of a bank we have the server taking note of all the transactions. Here the whole ledger is distributed among all the nodes (nodes can be any electronic device) in the network which further increases the transparency and security. This can be thought of as a collection of linked lists with a hash pointer. Data is stored in a block which is then permanently chained to other blocks using cryptographic methods. This is the reason behind the high security of blockchain. In order to tamper the data in a block, one needs to tamper all the blocks present across all the nodes, which essentially means that the change needs to be made in millions of computers in the network which is literally impossible and requires an insane level of computing power. The initial ideas of blockchain were developed during the last decade of the 20th century but it was the invention of bitcoin in 2008 by Satoshi Nakamoto, which unveiled the huge possibilities of blockchain. Blockchain is the underlying technology behind bitcoin which is a digital

										currency, also called cryptocurrency. Unlike physical currency like rupees or dollars, bitcoin is a virtual currency. It has no physical existence, rather it exists as a group of bits in an electronic device. You can send a digital currency like bitcoin or Ethereum to anywhere in the world without an intermediary like a bank. There are over 4000 cryptos in circulation
										as of now. Cryptos have truly democratized the world of finance, enabling you to hold your assets without the help of a central entity. This can be highly beneficial to people living in war-torn areas where no accountable government exists. So, in effect blockchain can be touted as the biggest equalizer of the 21st century. Now let's look specifically at the Indian scenario.
