									<h3>What Is Hacking?</h3>
									<p>“It is the usage of a security weakness to gain access to a system in an unauthorized way”.</p>

									<p>Well, the technical definition is pretty boring, isn’t it? Let me try to make it simple. Imagine that with a crooked mind and some skills of yours, you somehow made your friend give you their Instagram password, and later on, you logged in to his account without his knowledge and permission. That’s it, you are HACKER. You somehow managed to access his account and this is known as “hacking”. Believe me, if that friend of yours gives a complaint to the authorities, you “will” be punished. Yes, Hacking is 100 percent “illegal”.</p>

									<h3>What Is Ethical-Hacking?</h3>
									<p>“It is the usage of a security weakness to gain access to a system in an authorized way.”</p>

									<p>In much simpler terms, Ethical Hacking is a method by which a hacker gets into a system under the authorization of the system’s owner. Guess what, Ethical Hacking is completely “legal”. Since many non-ethical hackers are now trying to get into many databases around the world to steal the data, companies are very much concerned about their security. So, most of the companies hire such ethical hackers to improve the security of the company and also their products. </p>
									<h3>What Is Vulnerability?</h3>
									<p>“It is a weakness through which a system is open to attacks.”</p>

									<p>Let us imagine a person’s brain. If we feed a direct question into the brain, a specific answer will be given as a response. But what will happen if you feed a highly complicated question to it, definitely a break-down will occur. Similarly, a computer or a system will respond to a particular straight-forward task given to it, but if we give a complicated task, the system will fail. Points where the system is prone to failure is known as a vulnerability(weakness). Finding the vulnerability is one of the main steps involved in hacking into a system.</p>

									<h3>What Is Social Engineering?</h3>
									<p>The usage of non-technical methods to hack into a system is referred to as Social Engineering. One of the best examples is the one mentioned above, a person somehow gets the Instagram password of a friend. The vulnerability here is the human mind. Social engineering can also be used to gather as much information about the target. Social engineering may sound boring but trust me, it is the most important part of hacking and there is a saying that goes like-</p>

									<p><b>“Hacking is not magic. But a combination of Social Engineering and Knowledge.”</b></p>

									<h2>Hacking Methodologies</h2>
									<p>Methodologies are nothing but a systematic guidance of steps to hack a system. But as a hacker it is very important to understand all these 5 steps involved in hacking.</p>
									<h3>Phase 1: Information Gathering</h3>
									<p>In this phase we try to gather as much non-technical information as possible, such as company name, company CEO, owner’s personal details and many more. </p>
									<h3>Phase 2: Scanning Network</h3>
									<p>During this phase we use all the non-technical information to gather many networks as well as technical information such as IP address, open ports and also finding the vulnerability.</p>
									<h3>Phase 3: Gaining Access</h3>
									<p>In this phase we use intense codes and such to break into the system via the vulnerability found. Many languages are used to create such code, like python, which is the most common one.
									</p>
									<h3>Phase 4: Maintaining Access</h3>
									<p>Here we use a hidden backdoor mechanism or a trojan so that we will be able to get into the system very easily next time.</p>
									<h3>Phase 5: Clearing Logs</h3>
									<p>We should clear the system logs to remove all the traces of the work we have done on the target machine.</p>
								</div>
								
								<div class="col-md-12 animate-box">
									<p>Don't worry, I will explain the 5 steps with a simple example. Imagine our target is a closed box and our aim is to open it. Phase 1 is to gather information such as the color of the box, shape of the box, it’s size and so on. Phase 2 is to find a suitable key to open the box using the above data. Phase 3 is to use the key and open the box. Phase 4 is to create a duplicate key so that we can easily open the box next time without going through Phase 1, 2 and 3. And finally Phase 5 is to wipe off all the fingerprints on the box.</p>
									<p>Well, here it is, everything you need to know about the extreme basics of Ethical Hacking. And remember, it's all about the will to learn and practice. There are many tools out there to be used in each of the phases. Start learning one by one and you will be able to achieve your aim of becoming an Ethical Hacker.
