									<p>Technology is growing at a faster pace day by day, making our lives easier and more productive. Information security is always an inseparable part of technology and thus authentication plays a crucial role in dealing with security. There are different types of authentication methods like passwords, token authentication, two-factor authentication, biometric authentication, etc. It is always hard to remember a lot of passwords to get access into any account. Using a weak password or frequently using the same password on many other websites can be a threat to the user. But the authentication using biometric technology offers more safety and solves many issues faced during other authentications. </p>

									<p><h3>So what really is biometric authentication?</h3><br />


										Biometric authentication is a process for verifying a person’s identity using measurements or other unique characteristics of a person’s body and thereby allowing a user to log in to a service or an app or a device etc.  In simple words, biometrics is the name given for any type of body measurements and calculations. There are mainly two modes of biometric system: (i) Identification mode where the user is identified by a set of his/her data already stored in the database of the system (ii) Authentication mode where the user declares his/her identity and the system verifies it. Biometric mainly consists of methods that can uniquely distinguish humans based on their physical or behavioral traits. In human beings, certain characteristics like fingerprint, DNA, iris, face etc. are unique for everyone and these features are taken into account in case of biometric authentication.</p>

									<p><h3>How does biometric authentication work?</h3><br />

										In the process of biometric authentication, it actually compares two sets of data. The first one is already preset by the owner of the device whereas the second one is about the device visitor. When the two sets of data match, then the device will understand that both the owner and the visitor are the same and thereby the access to the device will be given to the visitor. An important thing to note is that matches between the two sets of data can be nearly identical but not exactly the same. It’s nearly impossible to have a 100% match for two sets of data.
										<br /><br />Biometric authentication is a two-step process: (a) The first step is the enrollment phase where the biometric information of an individual is collected and stored (b) The second step is to detect the data that is stored and then compare it with the information that was stored at the time of enrollment. If both the data matches, then the user is considered to be authentic. Every biometric process requires a sensor to detect the input samples and this data is called template. Thousands of image combinations are generated for a single authentication method.
									<br /><br />One of the most popular biometric technologies is fingerprint recognition and both Google and Apple don't make a copy of it on their servers, they store it on the device itself due to security issues. They won't even store the actual image of the fingerprint but only keep a mathematical representation of it. Thus if a malicious hacker reaches the mathematical representation, he cannot reverse it to get the actual image of the fingerprint. Other than this some other biometric technologies are iris scanner, face recognition system, hand geometry, voice recognition etc.
									<br /><br />Thus biometric authentication is highly reliable because human characteristics are much more difficult to forge than security passwords, codes, and key sensors. It is a rapidly growing technology which is used in forensics for criminal identification. Its applications include workstation and network access, single sign-in, application login, data protection, remote access to resources, transaction security, and web security.  Secure electronic banking, investing, other financial transactions, and retail sales are also getting benefited from this technology.
