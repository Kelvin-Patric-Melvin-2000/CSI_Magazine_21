									<p>I’ve always been fascinated by the concept of time travel. Though I was introduced to it in fictional books and the Japanese anime Doraemon, it’s a concept that never fails to impress me, even though I’m 18 now. 2 years ago, early March of 2019 to be precise, I chanced upon an article about a quantum computer that travelled 0.5 seconds back in time. I was intrigued and researched more on it since until then, I discarded the concept as being unrealistic. As a result of the research, I learnt more on the same and also on the effects of gravitational waves, which stretches and squeezes space, and was first discovered in 2015 using a very sensitive instrument called LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory). These first gravitational waves formed when two black holes collided approximately 1.3 billion years ago, but it took so long for the ripples to reach earth. In this article, I’ll be focusing on the former topic.</p>

									<p>On March 14 2019, researchers from the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology (MIPT), who teamed up with experts from the US and Switzerland, successfully reversed time through an IBM quantum computer, be it only for half a second. They hypothesized that time can spontaneously reverse itself for an individual particle for a really small fraction of time; thereby artificially creating a state that evolves in a direction opposite to the thermodynamic direction of time, according to the lead researcher Dr. Gordey Lesovik, who heads the Laboratory of the Physics of Quantum Information at the MIPT. The research was also able to calculate the probability that an electron in empty interstellar space will spontaneously travel back into its recent past.</p>

									<p>This is the third hypothesis [after Maxwell’s demon hypothesis suggested by the physicist James Clerk Maxwell; and the theory of gravitational waves suggested by Albert Einstein that gravitational waves could be a natural outcome of his general theory of relativity, which says that very massive objects distort the fabric of time and space, an effect we perceive as gravity] which can violate the second law of thermodynamics concerning the arrow of time, which states that time is linear and can travel in one direction alone, i.e., the forward direction.</p>

									<p>Quantum computing focuses on the principles of quantum theory, which deals with modern physics that explain the behavior of matter and energy at an atomic and subatomic level. Quantum computing makes use of quantum phenomena, such as quantum bits, superposition, and entanglement to perform data operations.</p>

									<p>Using the quantum computer, the researchers were able to unscramble a set of electrons. A quantum computer comprises electron qubits (quantum version of the classical binary bit physically realized with a two-state device) described by a “one”, a “zero”, or a “superposition” of both states. The time-reversal achieved an 85% success rate in the cases where 2 qubits were involved, but only 50% where 3 qubits were present.</p>

									<p>Even though critics do suggest that the statement is false and that the phenomenon is not a violation of the laws of quantum mechanics, this is only a hypothesis. Time reversal, though an exciting field, has the potential to harm the entire world when misused. So, let’s hope that only constructive researches and innovations breakthrough.</p>
