									<p>Hyperloop is a new form of ground transport currently in development by a number of companies. It could see passengers travelling at over 700 miles an hour in a floating pod which raced along inside giant low-pressure tubes, either above or below ground.</p>

									<p>  Hyperloop could be cheaper and faster than train or car travel, and cheaper and less polluting than air travel.  It's also quicker and cheaper to build than traditional high-speed rail. Hyperloop could therefore be used to take the pressure off gridlocked roads, making travel between cities easier, and potentially unlocking major economic benefits as a result.

									<h3>HOW DOES IT WORK?</h3>
									<p>The basic idea of Hyperloop is that the passenger pods or capsules travel through a tube, either above or below ground. To reduce friction, most -but not all - of the air is removed from the tubes by pumps. The Hyperloop capsules float above the tube's surface on a set of 28 air-bearing skis. One major difference is that it is the pod, not the track, that generates the air cushion in order to keep the tube as simple and cheap as possible. Other versions of Hyperloop use magnetic levitation rather than air skis to keep the passenger pods above the tracks.</p>

									<p> The pod would get its initial velocity from an external linear electric motor-- effectively a round induction motor rolled flat - which would accelerate it to 'high subsonic velocity' and then give it a boost every 70 miles or so; in between, the pod would coast along in near vacuum. Pods would depart every two minutes or every 30 seconds at peak usage.</p>

									<p>Under some models, the Hyperloop would be powered by solar panels placed on the top of the tube which would allow the system to generate more energy than it needs to run.</p>

									<h3>What will it feel like to travel in a Hyperloop?</h3>
									<p>Critics of Hyperloop have warned that travelling in the tube might be an uncomfortable experience, due to nausea-inducing acceleration, plus lateral G-force on bends in the route. However, Virgin Hyperloop One says that a journey via Hyperloop will feel about the same as riding in an elevator or a passenger plane. Although Hyperloop will be fast, the systems will accelerate with the same tolerable G-forces as that of taking off in a Boeing 747. Acceleration and deceleration will be gradual with no G-forces and turbulence. </p>
									<h3>HISTORY AND DEVELOPMENT OF HYPERLOOP</h3>

									<p>The idea of using low-pressure or vacuum tubes as part of a transport system has a long heritage. The Crystal Palace pneumatic railway used air pressure to push a wagon uphill and a vacuum to drag it back down way back in Victorian south London in 1864. Similar systems using pneumatic tubes to send mail and packages between buildings have been in use since the late nineteenth century, and can still be seen in supermarkets and banks to move money around today.</p>
									<p>One clear predecessor of the Hyperloop is the 'vactrain' concept developed by Robert Goddard early in the twentieth century; since then, many similar ideas have been proposed without much success.</p>
								</div>
							</div>

							<div class="row">
								<div class="col-md-12 animate-box">
									<p> However, it was entrepreneur Elon Musk who really reignited interest in the concept with his 'Hyperloop Alpha' paper in August 2013, which set out how a modern system would work -- and how much it would cost. In his Hyperloop Alpha paper, Musk set out the case for a service running between Los Angeles and San Francisco, which would be cheaper and faster than a proposed high-speed rail link. He argued that his Hyperloop could be safer, faster, more affordable, weather-proof, self-powering -- and less disruptive to people living along the route. Musk said that Hyperloop service could be the answer to travel between cities less than about 1500 km or 900 miles apart; beyond that, supersonic air travel would be more efficient. </p>
									<p>Rather than keeping the Hyperloop to himself, Musk threw the idea open to anyone who wanted to develop it. Indeed, in his Hyperloop Alpha paper, Musk noted that a number of areas still remained to be resolved including the control mechanism for Hyperloop capsules; station designs with loading and unloading of both passenger and passenger-plus-vehicle versions of the Hyperloop capsules; comparisons of Hyperloop with more conventional magnetic levitation systems; and testing to demonstrate the physics of Hyperloop. Despite doing much to lay the groundwork for Hyperloop services, Musk initially said he was too busy to develop his own service.</p>
								
								<p> There are now a number of companies working to turn the idea into reality, including start-ups and others that have been working on the idea for some time already. Among them are Virgin Hyperloop One, HTT, TransPod, Arrivo, and others. Each is developing a slightly different set of technologies, but the fundamental underlying idea remains the same.</p>
								<p> On November 8, 2020, after more than 400 unmanned tests, Virgin Hyperloop conducted the first human trial with Virgin Hyperloop executives Josh Giegel, its Co-founder and CEO, and Sara Luchian, Director of Passenger Experience, as the first passengers. They travelled at a speed of 172 km/h (107 mph) at the Virgin Hyperloop’s DevLoop test site in Las Vegas, Nevada. The test's safety process was validated by an Independent Safety Assessor.
								</p>
								<p>In January 2021, the company launched its vision for the future passenger experience.</p>

									<h2>What's next for Hyperloop?</h2>
									<p>Hyperloop is a technology that, for its supporters at least, could have a huge impact. It could reduce air travel between big cities, boost economies and trade, and reduce the pressure on housing in cities by allowing commuters to live further away. But none of this is anywhere near proven -- yet. There are major technical and business hurdles that Hyperloop technologies will need to surmount before they can carry passengers in comfort through a pneumatic tube, let alone change the world.
									</p>
									<p>The next stage for Hyperloop is to move beyond initial testing and feasibility studies, and start longer distance trials of the technology. Another challenge will be to find commercial models that work around the world. Only when all this is done will it become clear whether Hyperloop can really become a success. </p>
