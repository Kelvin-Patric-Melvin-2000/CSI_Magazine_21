									<h3>Kevin Mitnick</h3>
									<p>Top of the world-famous hacker list is Kevin Mitnick. The US Department of
										Justice called him the "most wanted computer criminal in US history." Kevin Mitnick's story is so wild that it was even the basis for a featured film
										called Track Down. </p>
										<p>After serving a year in prison for hacking into the Digital Equipment Corporation's network, he was let out for three years of supervised release. But near the end of that period, he fled and went on a two and a half
										year hacking spree that involved breaching the national defense warning system and stealing corporate secrets. Mitnick was eventually caught and convicted with a five-year prison sentence. </p>
									<p>After fully serving those years, he became a consultant and public speaker for computer security. He now runs Mitnick Security Consulting, LLC.

									<h3>Jonathan James</h3>
									<p>The story of Jonathan James, known as "c0mrade," is a tragic one. He began hacking at a young age, managing to
										hack into several commercial and government networks and was sent to prison for itâ€”all while he was still a minor.  
									</p>

									<p>James eventually hacked into NASA's network and downloaded enough source code (assets equaling $1.7 million at the time) to learn how the International Space
										Station worked. NASA had to shut down its network for three entire weeks while they investigated the breach, costing an additional $41,000.
									</p>
									
									<p>In 2007 several high-profile companies fell victim to numerous malicious network attacks. Even though James denied any involvement, he was suspected
										and investigated. In 2008, James committed suicide, believing he would be
										convicted of crimes he didn't commit.

									<h3>Albert Gonzalez</h3>
									<p>Albert Gonzalez is another of the best hackers in the world. He started off as the leader of a hacker group called ShadowCrew. In addition to stealing and selling credit card numbers, ShadowCrew also
										fabricated fraudulent passports, health insurance cards, and birth certificates for identity theft crimes. 
									</p>
									<p>Albert Gonzalez paved his way to internet fame when he collected more than 170 million credit card and ATM card numbers over a period
										of two years. He then hacked into the databases of TJX Companies and Heartland Payment Systems to steal all of their stored credit card numbers as well.
										Gonzalez was sentenced to prison for 20 years (two sentences of 20 years to be served simultaneously) and is scheduled for release in 2025.</p>

									<h3>Kevin Poulsen</h3>
									<p>Kevin Poulsen, also known as "Dark Dante," earned his 15 minutes of fame by utilizing his intricate knowledge of telephone
										systems. At one point, he hacked a radio station's phone lines and fixed himself as the winning caller, earning him a brand-new Porsche. The media dubbed him the "Hannibal Lecter of computer crime."
									</p>

									<p>Poulsen got himself onto the FBI's wanted list when he hacked into federal systems and stole wiretap information. He was
										later captured in a supermarket (of all places) and sentenced to 51 months in prison and a bill for $56,000 in restitution.
									</p>

									<p>Poulsen changed his ways after being released from prison in 1995. He began working as a journalist and is now a contributing editor for Wired. In 2006, he even helped law enforcement to identify 744 sex offenders on MySpace.</p>

									<h3>Gary McKinnon</h3>
									<p>Gary McKinnon, known as "Solo" on the internet, allegedly coordinated what would become the largest military computer hack of all time. Over a
										13-month period from February 2001 to March
										2002, McKinnon illegally accessed 97 computers belonging to the US Armed Forces and NASA. He claimed he was only searching for information
										on free energy suppression and UFO cover-ups, but according to US authorities, he deleted a number of critical files and rendered over 300 computers inoperable, resulting in over
										$700,000 in damages.
									</p>	
									<p>Being of Scottish descent and operating out of the United Kingdom, McKinnon was able to dodge the American government until 2005, when he faced
										extradition. After a series of appeals, the British Prime Minister at the time, Theresa May, blocked his extradition on the grounds that he was "seriously ill" and that extradition would be "incompatible with [his] human rights."
