									<p>Bhuvan, is the national Geo portal developed and hosted by ISRO comprising Geo Spatial Data, services and tools for analysis. It has many versatile features like:
										<br><br>(1) Visualization of satellite imagery and maps 
										<br>(2) Analysis 
										<br>(3) Free data download and
										<br>(4) Reports download to name a few.<br><br>
										The satellite images are multi-sensor, multi -platform and multi-temporal in nature and can be visualized in both 2D and 3D. Varieties of thematic maps are also hosted for analysis of various natural resources themes. Bhuvan platform supports many applications that address Governance and other Geospatial applications that are being used by the Central and State Government Departments, Academia and Industry.

									<p>Bhuvan made a modest beginning in 2009 with simple display of satellite data and basic GIS functionality with many thematic maps on display functionality. It has grown horizontally in diverse areas of applications and vertically in terms of number of image and map services including high-resolution satellite data. Presently, more than 6000 map services offered by Bhuvan are being used under various applications.
									<br><br>With administrative and hydrologic bases for the country, Bhuvan provides a strong foundation with 1m resolution satellite data for more than 350 cities which is being updated for large areas of the country. The Transport Network from National highways to City roads is also populated with more than 8.5 million Points of Interest locations. While Bhuvan hosts content for public consumption, there are a host of applications developed and deployed on a daily basis to enrich the usage of this platform. It is today reckoned as the unique GIS platform of the country that is freely accessible on the Internet and used by a wide variety of user communities including school children.
									<br><br>Bhuvan, as a platform, is open and being used by a diverse user community. The Government agencies use this platform to share and host their data as per their requirements, enabling specific applications of their choice. The crowd sourcing services are very popular for field data collection of various government programmes.

									<p>Some of the states using Bhuvan platform for specific applications are Punjab, Karnataka, Himachal Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh and North Eastern states. These are specific joint initiatives that address specific thematic applications in Forestry, Tourism, Municipal GIS, Geo-tagging and so on. These applications have paved the way for the use of space technologies, chaired by the Honourable Prime Minister of India. Many of the Ministries/Departments have linked their web portals to Bhuvan for online services. Bhuvan has become a popular platform that hosts one of the largest repositories of GIS maps and services in the country. Collaborative portal development makes use of Bhuvan as a common platform for the Stateâ€™s purpose while at the same time becoming national assets. To facilitate such similar activities across the country, Bhuvan presently hosts 30 state geo-portals, which is bound to further grow in terms of capabilities with collaborative efforts in the near future. There are many more examples of public sector, private users and NGOs who host their data and utilise the services of Bhuvan for a variety of purposes. One good example is the ENVIS program of the Ministry of Environment, Forests & Climate Change which is actively using Bhuvan services. Similarly, "Bhuvan Panchayats" a Web Portal is facilitating decentralised planning at grassroots level. As per the recent direction from the Government on the most effective use of space technology by user ministries, more than 20 ministry portals are unveiled and have been discussed during the National Meet.</p>

									<p>Space technology is being used for the benefit of society especially during natural disasters. Bhuvan supports management of disasters like Cyclone, Floods, Landslides, Earthquakes, Forest Fire and Drought, which is useful for various phases of disaster management including preparedness and response. Uttarakhand disaster in 2013, J&K floods and Hudhud Cyclone in 2014 and Nepal Earthquake in 2015 are some of the examples where Bhuvan provided unique services in terms of online disaster information update, forecasts and post-disaster scenario. Yet another important forewarning solution provided by Bhuvan is in the landslide forewarning system. The rain-induced landslide warning for major pilgrimage routes in Uttarakhand hills are being provided on an experimental basis for the past 2 seasons. This gives regular updates on the potential landslides alert based on rainfall and other parameters.
									<br><br>Bhuvan is also acting as a clearinghouse for satellite data and value added products. They are effectively used for scientific studies and help students, researchers and organisations to take up the scientific projects for applied research. 3.6 lakh products have been downloaded by users in the last three years and the NRSC Open EO Data Archive, as clearing house, has become widely popular. This includes scientific products generated by studying land, ocean and atmosphere under the National Information System for Climate and Environmental Studies (NICES).
