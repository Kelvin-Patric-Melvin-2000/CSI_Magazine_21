									<p>When we hear the word ‘Hypercars’, the names that pop up in our heads would be McLaren, Ferrari, Bugatti, Lamborghini, oh, you name them! But ever thought what would be defined as something that’s beyond a Hypercar? Well, the Koenigsegg Jesko is one of those cars which you’re looking for.
										<br><br>The Swedish Automobile manufacturer has a long record for bringing up new technologies which are unheard of to the world prior to them. They were one of the first companies to take steps toward eco-friendly tech with CCXR, made the first Megacar ever, the One: 1, the world record breaking Agera RS and so on.  They also have various patents for the technologies they come up with as well, developed and claimed by the founder Christian von Koenigsegg. Jesko is among the latest of them, which is, in the words of the founder himself, a complete replacement of Agera RS. Now that will give you an idea about what this incredible machine is offering us.

									<p>The Jesko was unveiled at the 2019 Geneva International Motor Show and was named after Christian’s father, Jesko von Koenigsegg, who in turn didn’t have an idea about it before it was presented to the world. This car strikes us with its elegant appearance, which includes its sleek headlamp, massive curved wing, naked carbon finished body and wheels, and so on.  But beyond its looks, the real shockers are its stats: talk about 300mph speed, over a thousand kilograms of downforce at high speeds, and a power to weight ratio greater than one; these are just a few of the impressive things about this car. It is indeed a noble tribute by a son to his father.
										<br><br>Let’s check out its engine specs- Jesko uses a 5L twin-turbocharged V8 engine, which was newly designed, with significant changes from the one used in Agera. This engine has the lightest V8 crankshaft, which helps in producing more power with efficiency, and produces 8500rpm at maximum. Also, it can produce 1280hp with normal gasoline, which is a large number by itself, but E85 (ethanol) biofuel can boost it up to 1600hp! This means while being eco-friendly, it can also be much more powerful. We can say this is a car made for our future.

									<p>The most impressive thing Koenigsegg did about this car is that they produced their own gearbox for Jesko, because the ones available in the market were not able to manage the power output. It is termed as Koenigsegg’s Light Speed Transmission (LST), which features a 9-speed multi clutch transmission, which is the second transmission produced by Koenigsegg, after the Direct Drive system for Regera, which features no clutches at all. The significance of LST is that it can switch between gears in virtually no time, which makes the transmission flawless. It also has the Ultimate Power On Demand (UPOD) technology which allows the gear to switch from all the way up from say, 7th to whatever lower gear which will provide with the highest power output at that particular time directly, which is calculated by the AI installed in the car. Also, this happens in a split second, which reduces the loss of time and power, making the car much more efficient. This makes LST the best of all gear systems ever made.
										<br><br>Jesko’s basic design is of a proper Koenigsegg’s, but it is still unique, and more aggressive than its predecessors. It may look smaller than them, but it’s just a design perk. It is much more spacious and has better visibility due to its wraparound windscreen.  As they eliminated empty spaces using crisp angles and lines all around its body, the car looks more agile as well, giving it a much appealing image.

									<p> The car has a fully robotized bodywork, which means its doors, hood and boot can be controlled using just its key or the control screen in front of the driver. And one of the best things about the appearance is that the doors go upward, which feels good to look at, and also avoids any obstacles beside the doors by not swinging outwards. Well, this new door has also gotten Koenigsegg another patent- talk about another feather on the hat.		
										<br><br>For a car with such intense performance figures, its components should be able to handle it. It is equipped with the Triplex Suspension system, which is indeed, developed by Koenigsegg themselves. It has two of them in the back and front side, which helps to keep the car at an optimum ride level at different speeds, especially when the downforce can exceed 1000 kilograms. The skeleton is made of carbon fiber, which makes it much stronger as well as lighter, which boosts the performance of the car. Its steering system can adapt and change the way the rear wheels turn at different speeds, which increases the turn speed and stability of the car, with more grip. Also, this is the most aerodynamically aggressive car that Koenigsegg ever made; and with another top speed oriented version named Jesko Absolut, they take it further ahead, with a drag coefficient of just 0.278, which is one of the lowest for a car in its class.

									<p>Coming inside the car, we can see a carbon finished interior along with leather, alcantara, etc. It’s spacious, large enough for a “short basketball player”, in the words of the founder. It also has cup holders, not one but two of them, in a car which is performance oriented. The top of the car can be removed for an open experience, and can be placed inside the hood. Its glove box has wireless charging as well, so if you’re thinking of a long drive after doing a lap in a track, you can buy some drinks and charge your phone and just let the wind kiss you while you’re on the road. Just like that.
										<br><br>Even though I couldn’t say each and every feature about this car, you might be wondering about the price, right? Well, “just” $2.8M US or 20.51 crore INR, excluding taxes. That is one hell of a price, but just think about the output it’ll give you; a comfortable, street friendly car, yet an aggressive and intimidating beast on track- how better can the price be justified? But even if you wanted to buy it, it’s impossible since it has been declared that all of the 125 units have been sold out. Maybe you are not lucky, or lucky enough to not have to spend such money on this awesomeness. But anyway, this Megacar will be a breakthrough for the future of the car industry, showing us how one can be so powerful and stunning, while being ecologically friendly simultaneously.
