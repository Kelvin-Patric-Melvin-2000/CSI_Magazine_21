									<p>Smartphones are becoming smarter in different, innovative ways that add comfort to the users. Protection,security of data is one of the best features of smartphones and that is what we actually want. And the first thing that attracts me is the different unlocking features present.</p>

									<p>Various phones including the latest iPhone use face recognition to unlock a phone. Face recognition technique has been around for decades and in recent years its application and use is widespread, thanks to artificial intelligence. This technology offers a powerful way to protect personal data and ensures that
										sensitive data remains inaccessible if the phone is stolen. Not only in the case of unlocking devices but face recognition systems have a wide range of applications in other fields like ID verification, security purpose, military purpose etc.

									<h3>HOW  DOES  THIS  WORK?</h3>
									<p>Face recognition has different technologies employed behind it and since the 1960s the field has been growing. The facial recognition technology marked its path when the first idea of the same was developed by Woodrow Wilson Bledsoe, who recorded the facial features manually and compared it with the most matched one in the database of already stored information. Different technologies have been developed  and used after this, for different parts specifically and more.</p>

									<p>At the initial stage the traditional method was used and as the knowledge grew many advancements and developments were

										encountered throughout the path from the traditional technology to 3D recognition, Human identification at a distance (HID) and more.</p>

									<p>The systems attempt to identify a human face, which is
										three-dimensional and changes in appearance with lighting and facial expression, based on its two-dimensional image. There are various steps to do this, facial recognition is a biometric tool as other technologies like fingerprints etc. This captures the person’s face measures landmarks like distance between eyes, width of nose, depth of eye sockets, distance from forehead to chin then this is converted to a mathematical formula which represents our unique facial signature after these steps the obtained information is checked with the existing database with many already available facial features for the best match. There are different softwares available for the same like FaceFirst is a
										popular facial recognition software. The software offers a full range of biometric surveillance, mobile and desktop forensic face detection capabilities to fight theft etc, Vision Insight an
										AI-powered analytics software using facial recognition, DeepVision and more.
										</p>

									<p>For iris recognition advanced devices were equipped with an infrared diode that illuminates your eyes regardless of the surrounding lighting conditions. This light wavelength can’t be detected by a regular front-facing camera, so a special infrared narrow focus camera then captures the detailed iris information. This image is then stored and processed locally on the device and this was employed in Samsung devices.</p>

										Devices like the one which is the latest in the market come equipped with an array of sensors designed to capture details of your face.  It uses an infrared flood light to illuminate your face, which will work regardless of your surrounding lighting conditions as it’s outside of the visible spectrum. A secondary 30,000-point infrared laser matrix is then beamed out, which reflects off the flood light. Rather than snapping a picture of this infrared light, a special infrared camera detects subtle changes in the matrix point reflections as your face makes small movements, which allows the camera to capture very accurate 3D depth data.3D IR depth mapping is by far the most secure method of facial recognition technology currently on the market. Unlike basic camera-based solutions, 3D IR technologies can’t be fooled by photographs and are faster and more reliable than ideas like iris scanning. Any IR implementation is better than a regular camera unlock, which we wouldn’t recommend using if you’re after tight security. Every system has its own advantages and drawbacks
										that should be analysed and needed to be improved. Face recognition has a wide range of applications which adds up its advantages like improved security system, improved surveillance efforts and helps track down criminals and has many benefits in society, including increasing safety and security, preventing crimes, and reducing human interaction. Like many other innovations in technology, there are problems arising with biometric systems. Data privacy is a very important thing for every individual using this technology, our facial records can be accessed and recorded in databases without our permission. According to a may 2018 report over 117 million American adults have their faces with the law enforcement face recognition network databases. And  the fact that it is easy to fool some face
										
										Recognition technologies have led some countries to actually ban the real time face recognition softwares.
										</p>
									<p>Currently, 3D face unlocking is the only face scanning technology currently on the market secure enough to use as authentication for mobile payments. But in spite of these innovations PIN or password system is considered to be the best and secure way of unlocking or identifying as these are hardest to track.</p>
