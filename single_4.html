									<p>Many of us are interested in space and this interest has only increased in the recent years when we started hearing the word “Blackhole” through newspapers and other such sources. Even before the general population was familiar with the term Blackhole, scientists had been working on Blackholes for many years. This is a very difficult task because they are so far away from Earth and also usually invisible. After more than a decade of scientific efforts, finally they were able to capture an image of a Blackhole. It is an achievement that not only the scientific community but mankind itself can be proud of. Technology has evolved according to human intellect to achieve such a great achievement in the astroworld. Under the mission - Event Horizon Telescope (EHT), scientists used Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) technology to capture the huge massive Blackhole. This mission created history.	</p>

									<p>Blackholes do not emit or reflect light. But luckily Blackholes are surrounded by orbiting gases that glow with heat. Still, imaging it is a difficult task. It can be only achieved through combined efforts of telescope operators. With the advent of telescopes, astronomers have been able to delve deep into space. A team of scientists was formed for the challenge. They devised a telescope network and this telescope network is called Event Horizon Telescope. EHT in April 2017 yielded the first image of the supermassive Blackhole, the one inside the galaxy, M87. EHT set out to capture the image of the Blackhole by improving upon a technique that allows for the imaging of far objects and this is the VLBI technology.</p>

									<p>Very Long Baseline Interferometry is a type of astronomical interferometry used in radio astronomy. In VLBI a signal from an astronomical radio source is collected at multiple radio telescopes on Earth or Space. The distance between the radio telescopes is then calculated using the time difference between the arrivals of the radio signal at different telescopes. Observations made simultaneously of an object are combined. VLBI is best known for imaging distant cosmic radio sources, spacecraft tracking, and for applications in astronomy. Telescopes of all types are used to see distant objects. To see objects in detail that are far away, we need to gather as much light as possible with very high resolution, so we need to use a telescope with a large aperture. That’s why the VLBI technology was essential to capturing the Blackhole image. VLBI picks up synchronised data (taken exactly at the same time) from eight different telescopes located across four different continents. These are in exotic places such as on top of volcanoes and in Antarctica. These radio telescopes see images in radio waves not in visible light. Four different teams processed the data independently. This data processing took over two overs and finally the goal was achieved.</p>

									<p>EHT is adding more radio telescopes to its array. It will also use more frequencies in the future. This will produce more data which can be used to develop clearer images and give us more insights into these strange objects. Though scientists theorized Blackholes, there was no evidence regarding its existence. With the help of technology, scientists accomplished what previously was thought to be impossible. Learning about mysterious structures in the universe provides insight into physics. The computer algorithms will surely find application in other areas as well. This is a triumph of modern collaborative science.</p>
