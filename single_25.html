A key or password that gives access to the front door to your home, your bedroom, your diary, your computer, your phone, your car, your safe deposit, your health records. Would you ever give this personal data to any stranger out there? Probably no, because it’s only a matter of time for someone to take advantage of it. So, why are you willing to give up your personal data to pretty much anyone who asks for it? I mean the technological giants, the unknown apps etc</p>

									<p>Privacy is the key that unlocks the aspects of yourself that are most intimate and personal, that make you unique, and most vulnerable. Your past, present and possible future. Your fears, your losses, your failures. The worst thing you have ever done, said, and thought. Your inadequacies, your mistakes, your traumas. The moment in which you have felt most ashamed. That family relation you wish you didn’t have. Your most drunken night. All this will be data available for the public.</p>

									<p>You might think your privacy is intact because you are a nobody – nothing special, interesting or important to see here. Don’t underestimate yourself. If you weren’t that important, businesses and governments wouldn’t be going to so much trouble to spy on you.</p>

									<p>Every company starting from MNC to small entrepreneurial firms, Government bodies, criminals, everyone is fighting for it. Everybody wants to know more about you. If you have money, companies want you to spend it on them, Hackers want your data to blackmail you, criminals use your identity to commit crimes on your name. You all have personal connections and companies ask to access your contact to connect with other people through you, whatever occupation you are doing, you are a node of this society. You are an important person.
									</p>

									<p>Now you all know that companies like Facebook and Google make money through data but that’s technically wrong because they are not selling your data. They sell the power to influence you. They sell the power to show you ads, and the power to predict your behaviour. Google and Facebook are not really in the business of data – they are in the business of power. They make us think in their way through their influence ,through ads. If we don't get influenced, they use their power.

									<p>In GOT the character named Littlefinger says- “Knowledge is power”. It is indeed true. Knowledge is an instrument to power. The more that someone knows about us, the more they can anticipate our every move, as well as influence us. When Google started it was just another unprofitable internet company. It didn’t have a sustainable business model back then. Then in 2000, it started a new feature called adwork, now called Google ads. It exploited the data produced by Google’s interactions with its users to sell ads. In less than four years, the company achieved a 3,590 per cent increase in revenue. In addition to keeping the company safe from competitors and allowing it to train its algorithm better, our data also allows tech companies to predict and influence our behaviour. With the amount of data it has access to, Google can know what keeps you up at night, what you desire the most, what you are planning to do next. It then whispers this information to other busybodies who want to target you for ads.</p>
									<p>Companies might also share your data with ‘data brokers’ who will create a file on you based on everything they know about you and then sell it to pretty much whoever is willing to buy it – insurers, governments, prospective employers, even fraudsters.</p>
									<p>It’s not all bad news, though. Yes, institutions in the digital age have hoarded privacy power, but we can reclaim the data that sustains it, and we can limit their collecting new data. When downloading apps and buying products, choose products that are better for privacy. Use privacy extensions on your browsers. Turn your phone’s wi-fi, Bluetooth and location services off when you don’t need them. Use the legal tools at your disposal to ask companies for the data they have on you, and ask them to delete that data. Change your settings to protect your privacy.</p>
									<p>Privacy is not only about you. Privacy is both personal and collective. When you expose your privacy, you put everyone at risk.  Privacy is a part of democracy. It is important in a democracy for people to select according to their belief, to read according to their mind, and speak what they want. To have this, power should be with people and not with any of the multinational companies or governments. Privacy is important because it gives power to the people. Protect it at all costs.</p>
