									<p>Wikipedia defines privacy as “the ability of an individual to seclude themselves or information about themselves, and thereby express themselves selectively”. As for security, “It is the freedom from, or resilience against potential harm caused by others”.
										Both of the terms in the context of the physical world are quite easy to grasp. In the digital world not so much. I’ll use one of my favourite analogies to explain these two concepts in the realm of the internet.
										It goes a little something like this,
										</p>

									<p>Consider all the devices that you use as a window in your room, a window to the world online. Now as in a real window you can look through this “digital window”, interact with people through it, watch everything that's happening outside like for example that cute cat that always hangs around your house. But unlike a real window you can do so much more through this digital window, like talk with people around the world, buy stuff from anywhere in the world, watch billions of cats related content, etc.</p>

									<p> Now as is with every window, as you can see all the stuff outside, an outsider can see you, and maybe even see what you do. In the physical world we have an easy way to combat this, it’s called a curtain or shade. This is privacy. The curtain or shade gives you control over your privacy. You can choose what others can see or know about you through your window. Similarly, a window is also vulnerable, unwanted visitors can gain access through this window. To combat this, we can put bars or grates on windows. This still provides you with all the functionality of a window. This is security.</p>

									<p>In the digital world, things are much more complicated than just drawing the curtains or closing a window. I’ll start with security. The first thing you have to always keep in mind is nothing is ever 100% secure online. There is always a flaw in the system. New security vulnerabilities are discovered every day in almost all pieces of software and threats that exploit such vulnerabilities. The second thing is your best defence against a security attack is caution. These include things like</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Don’t download unknown files, or from unknown sources.</li>
										<li>Don’t plug in unknown devices into your system.</li>
										<li>Update your devices and software/apps you use.</li>
										<li>Periodically change passwords.</li>
										<li>Don’t trust emails or other communications asking for information.</li>
										<li>Don’t connect to unknown networks.</li>
										<li>Don’t leave your devices left unattended at public locations or where other people might have access.</li>
										<li>Don’t login to your online accounts via untrusted devices or networks.</li>

									</ul></br>
									<p>And the list goes on, but from these points you might see that all of these tasks are not that difficult or complicated. In the case of most people, these are all the things that they can do, or should be expected of when using the internet.</p>

									<p>Up next, privacy. Privacy online is also more complicated than privacy in the real world. It is much easier to collect information or to spy on someone online than it is offline. Taking advantage of this, many data collection services and tracking systems exist. Collection of a user’s data treads very close to the fine line between required information and an invasion of privacy. Hence, almost everything online has a privacy policy and the vast majority of the time you have to agree to it to use a service or software. So, it might seem pointless to look for privacy online, and at times it is. For example, you might have heard of the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica scandal. The scandal concerned the collection of personal data of millions of Facebook users without consent by analytics firm Cambridge Analytica. The firm used an app they created on Facebook to ask a series of questions to build a phycological profile of the users, and also collected the personal data of the user’s Facebook friends. The information they collected was used to target highly personalised political advertisements to the people they profiled. This system was used to assist political leaders during the 2016 US presidential elections.</p>

									<p>To the 87 million users who were affected by this they might have just seen advertisements that agreed with everything they thought about and supported a political candidate they might or might not have voted for. They didn’t have the slightest clue that these adverts they saw were specifically tailored for them in a way changing the way in which they perceived the world.</p>

									<p>You might now see why your personal data is so valuable and why it should be protected. So, how might one go about doing that? The answer is very much similar to the one about security but might be a bit more difficult to implement or practice. In the case of privacy, there are three points to inspect. Your device, the connection and the service you connect to or use. Let’s look at each of them.</p>
									<ol>
										<li><b>Your device</b>
											<p>This consists of all your devices and their accessories that you use. The data that can be collected here include your</p>
											<ul>
												<li>location</li>
												<li>listening via a mic on the device</li>
												<li>record images via cameras on the device</li>
												<li>the apps you use</li>
												<li>the places you visit</li>
												<li>your browsing history</li>
												<li>information about the device you use</li>
												<li>the contacts saved on your device</li>
												<li>call history</li>
												<li>messages</li>
												<li>storage access</li>
												<li>The worst offender is the ability of apps to communicate between each other or to see what other apps on your phone are doing.</li></br>
											</ul>
											<p>Now, all this information might be required for the app or service to operate properly, like for example, take the case of Instagram and location data, it needs the data to suggest you the location of that photo you just took.</p>
										</li>
										<li><b>Your connection</b>
											<p>Privacy concerns arising from the connection you use to connect your devices to a network or the internet mostly come from necessary data collected by your internet service provider (ISP) like location data, DNS requests, etc. The implementation of content blocking by ISPs clearly shows how much of our network traffic is visible to them. Since ISPs can only block data when it is passing through their systems, they have to use advanced packet sniffing techniques to identify the data in the packet. Encrypting the connection using a proxy or a VPN can be used to ensure that your data isn’t read in transit.</p>
											<p>A lot of the data collected by ISPs are actually required for their systems to work, but that doesn’t necessarily mean that only the required data is collected or that this data is deleted after use or that this data is never shared with third-parties. For such details one would have to consult the privacy policy of the ISP, which to most users is impossible to understand or vaguely written.
											</p>
										</li>
										<li><b>Services</b>
											<p>This category includes all the networked services you use like search engines, email providers, cloud storage, social media, online banking, media streaming, online shopping platforms, and many more. Many of these services are “free” for users, but such services use the data collected from their users for advertisements which helps support the service or sell their user data to third-parties that collect large amounts of user data. Some rare services exist that rely on user donations and affiliate links instead of collecting user data.</p>
											<p>Privacy on online services is as or more difficult to achieve than privacy in public places. That said there are still steps here that one can take like.</p>
											<ul type="square"{}>
												<li>Using services that have a focus on user privacy. This includes privacy-oriented search engines, email providers, etc.</li>
												<li>Look into the settings menu, and adjust settings that collect user data. Many companies use an opt-out system for user data collection, i.e., the user can opt-out of being tracked. A great example is the user diagnostics and ad tracking settings in Android.</li>
												<li>Looking for alternatives to apps and services to commonly used apps and services based on their business models. Like using a paid version of a service instead of the free version. For example, cloud storage. Such services usually collect less user data or can be configured to do so because they are not relying on user data to make money.</li>
												<li>Using open-source software (OSS). Such software has their source code freely available to anyone online. With the source code being open source, development is usually carried out by volunteers from around the world. This means well maintained open-source software usually has high privacy and security standards. Another advantage of OSS is that it’s usually free.</li>
											</ul>
										</li>
									</ol>
									<p>This might all seem like a lot for some of you and that’s fine. So here are some frequently asked questions.</p>
									<h3>Why should I care about privacy?</h3>
									<p>You already do. Everyone has at least some expectations of privacy. Just like how we don’t share everything about our lives to everyone else, we should also expect that about our data online.</p>
									<p>But since a lot of our activities are moving online, there is an ever-increasing portion of lives being recorded by corporations and governments. And these records can be used to our disadvantage anytime, now or in the future. On a personal level stuff like discussing business with a partner, messages to your significant other, chats between friends, phone calls, your banking information, seeking help for depression or an addiction, all of your browsing and search history. Now this information could be used against you by anyone. For example, your employer who wants to lower your wages, a business or political competitor, a criminal, you can fill the rest.</p>
									<h3>Why should I care about privacy if I have nothing to hide?</h3>
									<p>Now that’s not true. You use passwords, you close doors, speak softly, at the very least you wear clothes, so you have something to hide. Similarly, you must have things that should reasonably be expected to be kept private online. Even if you have nothing to hide now, that doesn’t mean you’ll never have stuff that requires privacy, or that the things you don’t hide now won’t be used against you in the future.</p>
									<h3>What can I do to protect my privacy?</h3>
									<p>Privacy online isn’t absolute. There are various compromises we make many times a day, when we are willing to give up privacy in exchange for convenience. Other times, we don’t even realise our privacy is compromised. The point is we must retain some control over our information. Here are some measures you can take to protect your privacy.</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Use encryption wherever available/possible.</li>
										<li>Support groups that protect your digital rights.</li>
										<li>Voice your opinion against groups that are selling out your right to privacy from under you.</li>
										<li>Educate those close to you on why they should care.</li>
									</ul>
									<p>There are a lot of technical measures you can take too. You might not be able utilise or implement all of these but the ones you can are a start.
										You can find privacy-focused alternatives to the software and services you use here:
										
									<ul>
										<li>privacytools.io</li>
										<li>prism-break.org</li>
									</ul></p>
									<p><b>Quick pro-tip:</b></br>Signal>Telegram (secret chats only)>WhatsApp</br> This is the ordering of popular messaging apps from most to least secure and private. Communications via Instagram chats and Snapchat are not secure.</p>
									<p><b>In conclusion:</b></br>Achieving privacy and security online is a constant battle. One that can seem impossible at times. But one that can never be surrendered to. Demand and support for better privacy and data protection laws by your government. Hope you understood or learnt something. Thank you for reading.</p>
